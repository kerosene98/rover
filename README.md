# ROVER

Inspired by recent dables in satelitte tracking, cubesats and automation. I have chosen an ongoing robotics project I have been working on during my freetime to be used as an example of my work. 

Initially this project started out as a robotic toy/autonomous vacuum cleaner/autonomous lawnmower idea. As the time passed I thought more about the application to the field of space and space research as a business and service. 

So this is a work in progress, towards a robot/rover demonstration project. 

Intended audience : Potential employers,contracting agencies and/or future customers.

Basic keys to mission success is movement, followed by automation and real world sensing / environment feed back. As the project progresses then add-ons such as test modules and additional sensors could be added.

This project will be a conbination of embedded C and RUST. Biggest reward from this project will be the learning curve and pushing the curve of understanding and experimentation.
